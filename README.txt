== Description ==

Just another contact form plugin. Simple but flexible.

Contact Form 7 can manage multiple contact forms and you can customize the form and the mail contents flexibly with simple markup. The form supports Ajax-powered submitting, CAPTCHA, Akismet spam filtering, and so on.

Since it got published in August 2007, Contact Form 7 has been translated into a lot of languages. I want to express my appreciation for their contributions.
